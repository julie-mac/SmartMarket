  ## Description

  SmartMarket is a back-end e-commerce application for managers of an internet retail company that uses Sequelize to be able to find, add, and update database information
  
  ## Installation
  
  First, clone the repository to your local machine. Then install the npm packages via the command line by typing "npm install", then edit or create a ".env" file containing the database name, your SQL username and password. Then, you'll want to create a database using the MySQL shell or MySQL Workbench with the following commands: 

    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ecommerce_db;
    CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
    USE ecommerce_db

Then run the seed files by typing "npm run seed" in the command line, and start the server by either typing "node server.js" or "npx nodemon server.js".

  ## Usage
  
  Once you've started the server, test out the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints via Insomnia to view, add to or update the database.
